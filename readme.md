This project was developed during the Hackathon organized by ReNepal on May 30, 2015. 

We developed a web application and android application for the disaster relief management in order to encourage collaboration among the participating organizations in earthquake relief programmes.

Following are the goals of this web application:
- To aid the private profit and non-profit organizations to collaborate with of the local government bodies for the even distribution of relief materials.
- To provide a common ground and easy communication platform for the organization and the government entities.
- To make the distribution of relief materials transparent to the public which will reduce the chance of corruption.
- To reduce the duplication of distribution of relief materials in a place.
- To circulate the proper information about the type of relief material required in a particular disaster
hit area.
- To aid the organization to reach the disaster hit area.
- To aid the government bodies for the proper planning and implementation for the distribution of
relief materials.

In order to do so, we developed an easy to use, and efficient web-based solution that will be available to the government, participatory organizations and general public. The website encourages information disclosure of where and how the relief materials are being distributed. The website will aid the government in keeping track of the relief programmes. The disaster relief organizations are heavily benefitted by the readily available information among other similar voluntary organizations. This joint effort will provide information history of efforts in the past as well as future plans. The general public is kept in the loop of how these programmes are being organized, co-ordinated and scheduled. We hope that our sincere efforts will help in in the reduction of relief material duplication and associated distribution problems due to lack of transparency and information availability.
